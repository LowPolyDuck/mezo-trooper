## Gameplay Overview

*Mezo Troopers* throws players into a win-big-or-lose-everything scenario where they fight to gain points across various territories. With each command, players engage with BitcoinFi assets, putting their points at risk to rise through ranks in challenging zones.

### How to Play

Commands are simple but effective, helping players attack, defend, and navigate through territories:

- **/attack**: Launch an attack to earn points. Success depends on your territory and chosen power level.
- **/defend**: Defend against CEX attacks, risking points but earning big if successful.
- **/wormhole**: Move to a higher-risk territory for higher potential rewards by using points as gas fees.
- **/leaderboard**: See the current top *Mezo Troopers*, their points, and territories.
- **/points**: Displays your personal stats, including current points, rank, and territory.

### Territories

Players progress through increasingly challenging territories, with each step unlocking greater rewards but adding to the risk:

1. **Satoshi’s Camp**: Training zone with moderate rewards and minimal risk.
2. **Yield Farming Base**: Intermediate zone with higher rewards for defending BitcoinFi.
3. **Lending Command**: High-risk zone linked to BitcoinFi lending activities. Losing here costs all points and results in a territory drop.
4. **Experimental Frontier**: The ultimate zone for testing BitcoinFi assets. Maximum points on offer, but losses will send you back to a lower territory.
