# Mezo Troopers Game

**Mezo Troopers** is a high-stakes, *Starship Troopers*-inspired Discord game designed for the Mezo ecosystem. In Mezo Trooper, players are guardians of a decentralized Bitcoin economy, battling against “The Fiat Bugs”—entities that embody threats like inflationary fiat money, centralized banking, and restrictive financial controls. These “bugs” are infestations trying to undermine Mezo’s Bitcoin-powered economic layer, attacking by attempting to inject fiat instability, centralization, and surveillance tactics into the system.

## Gameplay Overview

As *Mezo Troopers*, players' mission is to defend Bitcoin’s value and its decentralized nature. Using commands like /attack and /defend, players can face off against these symbolic “bugs” and earn points that represent their contributions to Bitcoin’s integrity. Higher levels or territories might include places like the Yield Frontier or the BitcoinFi Stronghold, representing layers of Bitcoin utility within Mezo’s economy, each with more substantial rewards and risks.

### How to Play

Commands are simple but effective, helping players attack, defend, and navigate through territories:

- **/attack**: Launch an attack to earn points. Success depends on your territory and chosen power level.
- **/defend**: Defend against CEX attacks, risking points but earning big if successful.
- **/wormhole**: Move to a higher-risk territory for higher potential rewards by using points as gas fees.
- **/leaderboard**: See the current top *Mezo Troopers*, their points, and territories.
- **/points**: Displays your personal stats, including current points, rank, and territory.

### Territories

Players progress through increasingly challenging territories, with each step unlocking greater rewards but adding to the risk:

1. **Satoshi’s Camp**: Training zone with moderate rewards and minimal risk.
2. **Yield Farming Base**: Intermediate zone with higher rewards for defending BitcoinFi.
3. **Lending Command**: High-risk zone linked to BitcoinFi lending activities. Losing here costs all points and results in a territory drop.
4. **Experimental Frontier**: The ultimate zone for testing BitcoinFi assets. Maximum points on offer, but losses will send you back to a lower territory.
