# Mezo Troopers Game

## Project Description

**Mezo Troopers** is a high-stakes, _Starship Troopers_-inspired Discord game designed for the Mezo ecosystem. In Mezo Trooper, players are guardians of a decentralized Bitcoin economy, battling against “The Fiat Bugs”—entities that embody threats like inflationary fiat money, centralized banking, and restrictive financial controls. These “bugs” are infestations trying to undermine Mezo’s Bitcoin-powered economic layer, attacking by attempting to inject fiat instability, centralization, and surveillance tactics into the system.

This gamified experience on Discord challenges players to protect Bitcoin's decentralized values and gain points at the end of each 24 hour round. This game leverages simple commands, dynamic interactions, and a progression-based territory system that mirrors increasing layers of complexity in Mezo’s decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Gameplay Overview

As _Mezo Troopers_, players' mission is to defend Bitcoin’s value and its decentralized nature. Using commands like /attack and /defend, players can face off against these symbolic “bugs” and earn points that represent their contributions to Bitcoin’s integrity. Higher levels or territories might include places like the Yield Frontier or the BitcoinFi Stronghold, representing layers of Bitcoin utility within Mezo’s economy, each with more substantial rewards and risks.

### How to Play

Commands are simple but effective, helping players attack, defend, and navigate through territories:

- **/attack**: Launch an attack to earn points. Success depends on your territory and chosen power level.
- **/defend**: Defend against CEX attacks, risking points but earning big if successful.
- **/wormhole**: Move to a higher-risk territory for higher potential rewards by using points as gas fees.
- **/leaderboard**: See the current top _Mezo Troopers_, their points, and territories.
- **/points**: Displays your personal stats, including current points, rank, and territory.

### Territories

Players progress through increasingly challenging territories, with each step unlocking greater rewards but adding to the risk:

1. **Camp Satoshi**: Training zone with moderate rewards and minimal risk.
2. **Mats Farming Base**: Intermediate zone with higher rewards for defending BitcoinFi.
3. **Mezo Command**: High-risk zone linked to BitcoinFi lending activities. Losing here costs all points and results in a territory drop.
4. **BitcoinFi Frontier**: The ultimate zone for testing BitcoinFi assets. Maximum points on offer, but losses will send you back to a lower territory.

## Features

- **Leaderboards**: A visible, dedicated leaderboard tracks the top players, updating with each action.
- **Win Big or Lose Everything**: Failure to defend or succeed means losing all points, making each decision high-stakes.
- **Strategic Boosts**: Randomized boosts can multiply points when players select the right action, adding a layer of strategy to each command.

## How to Join

Simply join the Discord server and use any of the commands to start playing. Progress through the territories, accumulate points, and see if you have what it takes to reach the top!
